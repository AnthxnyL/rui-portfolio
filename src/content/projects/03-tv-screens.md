title: 03. TV SCREENS
description: >-
  During my last internship, I had the opportunity to work on TV screen
  interfaces. 


  This experience allowed me to experiment with different types of on-screen content, particularly optimizing the presentation of quotes for maximum impact and readability in this specific case.
