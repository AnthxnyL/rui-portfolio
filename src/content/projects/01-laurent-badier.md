title: 01 - LAURENT BADIER
description: >-
  Test this project, I worked on the redesign of the Laurent Badier website while redefining its brand strategy.
  
  
  Combining marketing (positioning, pricing, communication) and design (UX research, wireframing, prototyping), we aimed to align the brandâ€™s identity with its values while enhancing the user experience.
